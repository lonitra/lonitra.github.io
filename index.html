            I am a Vietnamese first generation college student at the University of Washington in Seattle going into my third
            year studying computer science. At the university, I am involved with the <a href ="https://www.engr.washington.edu/stars" target="_blank"> STARS engineering program </a> as a member of cohort V
            where I have cultivated a strong sense of belonging & support within this big university and built a strong foundation and understanding of my own learning process.

          <p class="abme" ID="projects">
            This summer, I will be working at Facebook as a <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/careers/FBUEngineering" target="_blank"> Facebook University for Engineering</a> intern in Menlo Park, California where I will be delving into
            Android app development, challenging myself both professionally to build an innovative app and personally to step out of my comfort zone, and of course, having tons of fun &#9787;

            <h2> <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/163324351/" target="_blank"> Corgi Adventure</a></h2>
            <p>
              Corgi Adventure is a cute game I made with Scratch. Although it
              was originally an assignment that was categorized as "for fun" in my high school calculus
              class, I took this assignment pretty seriously and took the initiative to
              try to make this game reminiscent of the types of games I played as a child.
              When I was younger I played a lot of video games like Pokemon and Kirby.
              I really wanted my game to reflect these games' cute and innocent aesthetic yet
              slightly challenging gameplay. With Corgi Adventure, I believe I have
              achieved that. It screams all the attributes of my childhood with my
              older self's ambitions of pursuing computer science and engineering. This
              game, although it may not be a very technical project, is therefore
              very sentimental to me in that it
              portrays a significant part of my life as I begin my journey in computer science.

          <p>
            HERD is a my very first group project. It is a web application I made
            with my teammates during my time at
            <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/#!?detail-content-tabby_activeEl=overview" target="_blank"> Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI)</a>. Have you ever wanted
            to go eat out, but didn't want to have to wait for anything more
            than 5 minutes to get seated?
            Time is especially limited as a college student. With classes, studying, and
            extracurricular activities,
            I definitely don't want to spend time waiting in line to get food.
            We envisioned HERD to help with that. HERD allows the user to see how
            many others are in a certain location so that they can account for traffic
            and effectively manage their time. This was the idea of HERD.
            Although we were not able to complete our vision for HERD due to the
            time constraint of a week that we were given. We were able to produce
            a MVP of storing user location and alerting users how many HERDERS or users
            were in their area.
