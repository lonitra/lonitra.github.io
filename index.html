          <p class = "abme">
            I am a Vietnamese first generation college student at the University of Washington in Seattle going into my third
            year studying computer science. At the university, I am involved with the <a href ="https://www.engr.washington.edu/stars" target="_blank"> STARS engineering program </a> as a member of cohort V
            where I have cultivated a strong sense of belonging & support within this big university and built a strong foundation and understanding of my own learning process.
          </p>
          <p class="abme">
            This spring, I will be joining Microsoft as a Software Engineer intern on the C&AI team where I will have my first experience dabbling
            in large systems and learning to ship quality code. In the summer I will be returning to Facebook
            where I will continue to grow as an aspiring software engineer. &#9787;

            <h2> <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/163324351/" target="_blank"> Corgi Adventure</a></h2>
            <p>
              Corgi Adventure is a cute game I made with Scratch. Although it
              was originally an assignment that was categorized as "for fun" in my high school calculus
              class, I took this assignment pretty seriously and took the initiative to
              try to make this game reminiscent of the types of games I played as a child.
              When I was younger I played a lot of video games like Pokemon and Kirby.
              I really wanted my game to reflect these games' cute and innocent aesthetic yet
              slightly challenging gameplay. With Corgi Adventure, I believe I have
              achieved that. It screams all the attributes of my childhood with my
              older self's ambitions of pursuing computer science and engineering. This
              game, although it may not be a very technical project, is therefore
              very sentimental to me in that it
              portrays a significant part of my life as I begin my journey in computer science.

          <p>
            HERD is a my very first group project. It is a web application I made
            with my teammates during my time at
            <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/#!?detail-content-tabby_activeEl=overview" target="_blank"> Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI)</a>. Have you ever wanted
            to go eat out, but didn't want to have to wait for anything more
            than 5 minutes to get seated?
            Time is especially limited as a college student. With classes, studying, and
            extracurricular activities,
            I definitely don't want to spend time waiting in line to get food.
            We envisioned HERD to help with that. HERD allows the user to see how
            many others are in a certain location so that they can account for traffic
            and effectively manage their time. This was the idea of HERD.
            Although we were not able to complete our vision for HERD due to the
            time constraint of a week that we were given. We were able to produce
            a MVP of storing user location and alerting users how many HERDERS or users
            were in their area.

    <h2> <a href = "https://github.com/FBUAndroidTeam/HelpQ" target="_blank"> HelpQ</a></h2>
    <p>
      HelpQ is an android app I made with my teammates during my Facebook University for
      Engineering (FBU) internship in the summer of 2019. During the first three weeks
      of the internship, interns go through a mobile development (either android or iOS) bootcamp with
      CodePath. During the bootcamp, my teammates
      (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassandra-cabrera-7b7582159/" target="_blank">Cassandra Cabrera</a>
      &
      <a ID="resume" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-kallini-4baa85188/" target="_blank">Julie Kallini</a>)
      and I were frustrated with the communication system
      between admininstrators and interns in order to get help. The means of communication was essentially
      a Google Docs acting as a queue; you could imagine the frustration. We therefore made HelpQ to revamp the
      CodePath training that FBU Engineering interns experience during the first three weeks of their internships
      by facilitating smoother communication between interns and administrators.
